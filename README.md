# FindAllTransferApprovalEvents

## Purpose

This project is meant to create a universal application that would find all the Transfer and Approval events of an (ERC 20) asset for given ethereum user from the event logs generated by those ERC20 assets.

## Technologies Implemented

MERN stack (MongoDB atlas, Express, React.js and Node.js were employed in this project) along with Web3.js and Solidity.

## Development phases

The project is in its Testing phase and once testing is finished the code will be made ready for production.
Hence some code that still contains specific block addresses, ERC20 asset address and ethereum user addresses will be cleared.
